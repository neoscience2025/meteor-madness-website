  "explanations": {
    "energyExplainer": "This shows how much energy the asteroid releases. For comparison, the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima released about 15 kilotons (0.015 MT) of energy.",
    "craterExplainer": "When an asteroid hits solid ground, it creates a crater. The size depends on the asteroid's size, speed, and composition.",
    "blastExplainer": "The explosion creates pressure waves that damage buildings and can be lethal. Higher pressure values cause more severe damage.",
    "thermalExplainer": "The intense heat from the impact can cause burns and ignite fires. Higher thermal flux values cause more severe burns.",
    "seismicExplainer": "Large impacts create earthquakes. The magnitude follows the same scale used for natural earthquakes.",
    "casualtiesExplainer": "These estimates are based on population density data and assume no evacuation or shelter."
