    "description": "To build an application that converts open data on meteors and NEOs (Near-Earth Objects) into actionable decisions. This involves visualizing trajectories and events, estimating energy/impact, and simulating 'what-if' scenarios. The application must communicate risk clearly and educationally, featuring near real-time interaction."
