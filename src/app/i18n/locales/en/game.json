    "summary": "The DART mission was NASA’s first planetary-defense experiment showing that a spacecraft could deflect an asteroid by crashing into it. It used the kinetic impactor technique—launching an object at high speed to change another body’s path without destroying it, like nudging a billiard ball in space. In this mini-game, you play that spacecraft: each shot is a precise impact that alters incoming meteors before they reach Earth. This concept can save our planet, because a small change in an asteroid’s direction—done early enough—can prevent a global catastrophe. So every time you fire, you’re not just playing: you’re reenacting the same principle that could protect humanity.",
